# About

This project is an entry into the AWS Graviton2 Hackathon. The project's backend services allow users to query through hundreds of GB of OpenStreetMap (OSM) and request custom vector layers built on top of this data. The [webpage](https://tiles.maphub.dev/index.html) offers a convenient graphic interface to explore and visualize your custom layers.
